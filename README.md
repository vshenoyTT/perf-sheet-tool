**Perf Sheet Analysis Tool**

An easy-to-use performance sheet analysis tool for Tenstorrent models. Built using Streamlit for the interface, along with Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and sheet formatting.

The tool is deployed for use <a href="https://perfsheet.streamlit.app" target="_blank">here</a>.

To run locally, install the requirements from requirements.txt with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, within the directory, run the command `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`. The web tool will default to opening on `http://localhost:8501` unless port 8501 is occupied.
